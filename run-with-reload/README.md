# might need sudo try it first without
sudo npm install reload -g
# then cd into this folder
cd path/to/where/this/folder/is/basic-coding-crash-course/run-with-reload/
# and start the relaod server
# the server is pretty cool
# he not only reloads your content on save
# he also reloads your browser
# execute it with
reload
```
